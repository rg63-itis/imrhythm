  In my journey of Leadership .. like everyone ..  I too have had my share of failures and wins. Luckily, had more wins than failures.. Both - my failures and my wins, have enriched my journey. What probably helped me most, is that I have always made a mental note of my decisions that lead me to those wins or failures. I always kept experimenting with decisions that lead me to failure and continued with decisions that lead me to wins. At times I researched, explored, refered books/blogs/articles/etc, asked my peers/mentors/teammates.. 

  Few of my learnings and experience, I am posting here.. Hope, you benefit from it .. You can consider these posts as collation of my experience and learnings.. I do not take credit for all what I have posted here.. I have attempted to acknowledge work of respective individuals/organisation/company.. If I have missed out someone, feel free to reach me .. Ways to reach me are mentioned on [Contact](https://imrhythm.co.in/#contact) page .. There could be delay, but I surely will update/correct/revert back..
