  In my journey of Leadership .. like everyone ..  I too have had my share of failures and wins. Luckily, had more wins than failures.. Both - my failures and my wins, have enriched my journey. What probably helped me most, is that I have always made a mental note of my decisions that lead me to those wins or failures. I always kept experimenting with decisions that lead me to failure and continued with decisions those lead me to wins earlier. At times I researched, explored, refered books/blogs/articles/etc, asked my peers/mentors/teammates.. 

  My posts here are collation of my experience and learnings. Have attempted to keep them crisp and to the point. Hope, you benefit from it and get a headstart.. 
  
  I do not take credit for all what I have posted here.. some of them have been referenced from something I have came accross in my journey ..may an online article I read, an online video I saw, may a quote I saw on some random street that I saw while driving or may be someone mentioned during our casual talk.. I have attempted to acknowledge and give credit to those respective individuals/organisation/company.. If I have missed out someone, feel free to reach me .. Ways to reach me are mentioned on [Contact](https://imrhythm.co.in/#contact) page .. There could be delay in response, as I do not actively blog, but I surely will update/correct/revert back..
