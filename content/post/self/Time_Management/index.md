**Essentialism** 

***Get Right Things Done !!.. NOT more things done..***

Right things are ..  Things that are inline with your growth .. Things that are "Actually" required/expected from you in your role .. 

Time and Energy is is constant for everyone. With success, more people will want to partner with you, thus seeking your time & energy. It very important to have **Wise Investment of Your Time & Energy**. Its pernicious to say "Yes" to each and everything that comes your way. If you dont choose how to spend your time & energy, others will choose for you. 

To be able to make that decision about where to invest your time and energy, one **"Must Find Time"** to think what is required/right thing to be done & what must be skipped

**Plan out your work and Work out your plan!**
