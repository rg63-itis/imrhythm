**Essentialism** 

***Get Right Things Done !!.. NOT more things done..***

Right things are ..  Things that are inline with your growth .. Things that are "Actually" required/expected from you in your role .. 

It very important to understand **Wise Investment of Your Time & Energy**

And to be able to make that decision about where to invest your time and energy, one "MUST" find time to think what is required/right thing to be done & what "MUST" be skipped
