  Realized it pretty late in my life.. but its still not late realisation .. ***"Self Management"*** is the only Mantra one needs in life to be successfull .. be it  Professional Life, Social Life, Family Life or Personal Life ... Each part of your life is very distinct and a harmonious balance amongst all of them is key to being able to lead a contented life.
  My posts here are collation of ideas that I came accross and have influenced me or impacted me for good, expereinces and observations. I have attempted to keep them crisp and to the point. Hope, you benefit from it and get a headstart.. 
  
**Disclaimer :**  I do not take credit for all what I have posted here.. some of them have been referenced from books I read or something I have came accross in my journey ..may an online article I read, an online video I saw, may a quote I saw on some random street that I saw while driving or may be someone mentioned during our casual talk.. I have made an genuine attempted to acknowledge and give credit to those respective individuals/organisation/company.. If I have missed out someone, feel free to reach me ..
