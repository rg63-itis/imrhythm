## Essentialism is the Key

***Get Right Things Done !!.. NOT more things done..***

Right things are ..  Things that are inline with your growth .. Things that are "Actually" required/expected from you in your role .. 

Time and Energy is is constant for everyone. With success, more people will want to partner with you, thus seeking your time & energy. It very important to have **Wise Investment of Your Time & Energy**. Its pernicious to say "Yes" to each and everything that comes your way. If you dont choose how to spend your time & energy, others will choose for you. 

To be able to make that decision about where to invest your time and energy, one **"Must Find Time"** to think what is required/right thing to be done & what must be skipped

**Plan out your work and Work out your plan!**

## Toolkits that help Manage Focus

***1. Eisenhower Decission Matrix***

{{< figure src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rg63-itis/imrhythm/master/content/post/self/Time_Management/The-Eisenhower-Decision-Matrix-png-1024x768.jpeg" title="" >}}

- Categories your tasks as below matrix.
- Attempt to reduce task list as low as possible in "DO" quardrant .. Should not be more than 3 or should not take more than 20% of your work day.
- 40% of your work day should be spent on "scheduled" tasks.. Tasks that were scheduled as in "Decide" quardrant.
- Not more 5% of your work day should be spent on "delegated" tasks .. Those in "Delegated" quardrant.
- Offcouse .. 0% on Deleted tasks
- Rest of your work day -- well -- there will be meetings, plannings, research that you would have to do..  

***2. Pareto 80-20 Rule***

There might still be days, where one feels overwhelmed.. At those instances, follow Pareto 80-20 rule.. which states that for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes .. And its not a very random rule.. it has been observed by researchers with quite a detailed study and is widely accepted law. I persoanlly have experienced it almost everywhere I have been conscious to take a note of it.

Applying the same, identify tasks that needs only 20% ( or less ) of your effort/time/energy and yet the result would be higher ..
